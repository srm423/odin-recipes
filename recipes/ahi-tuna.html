<p>Poke <em>(pronounced POE-keh)</em> is a Hawaiian dish. Its name derives from the Hawaiian word "to slice or cut." The name is a good indicator of what the dish is because poke is traditionally sliced raw fish (usually tuna or octopus) that's marinated in a savory, umami-rich sauce made with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions.</p>

<p>Poke can be eaten as is, but it's typically served in a poke bowl with other ingredients â€” like rice, vegetables, and hot sauce.</p>
<p>This simple poke recipe is a refreshing Hawaiian salad featuring cubed fresh ahi tuna, tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions, creating a dish packed with rich umami flavors.While not traditional, Chef <strong>Josh Chan</strong> likes to add macadamia nuts.This recipe serves 4 as a main dish or 8 as an appetizer.</p>
